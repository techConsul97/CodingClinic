Today's Sumarry:

Gave as an assignment the creation of an app that needs to:

1. Implement Clean Architecture (data, domain, presentation package)
2. As for each person's judgement, decide if your use_case package has a point of being in your project
3. Implement local caching, your preferred technology. As you use an API, Single source of Truth needs to be used
4. Upgrade the compose version to the last stable version. Meaning you will have to look for versions compatible with it
5. Use LiveData or Flows for data
6. Use State instead of StateFlow


Scope of the assignment:

-Learn how to migrate projects from "old" versions of Compose to the latest ones
-Write "clean-code" using clean architecture and Solid Principles
-write testable code as for tests to be easily implemented
-practice Compose, as it will replace XML in the future
-learn flows instead of LiveData
